        [Intro: Lata Mangeshkar]<br />
        Kaliyon ka chaman tab banta hai<br />
        Thoda resham lagta hai<br />
        Thoda sheesha lagta hai<br />
        Heere moti jadte hain<br />
        Thoda sona lagta hai<br />
        Thoda resham lagta hai<br />
        Thoda sheesha lagta hai<br />
        Heere moti jadte hain<br />
        Thoda sona lagta hai<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 1: Truth Hurts]<br />
        He breaks, me down, he builds, me up<br />
        He fills, my cup, I like, it rough<br />
        We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall<br />
        He comes, in late, but it's, o.k<br />
        He do, I do, he knows, the rules<br />
        He takes care of home, though he's not alone<br />
        I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean<br />
        And gives, me things, he makes, me scream<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus: Truth Hurts, (Lata Mangeshkar)]<br />
        (Thoda resham lagta hai)<br />
        He's so contagious<br />
        (thoda sheesha lagta hai)<br />
        He turns my pages<br />
        (Heere moti jadte hain)<br />
        He's got me anxious<br />
        (thoda sona lagta hai)<br />
        He's what I waited for<br />
        (Thoda resham lagta hai)<br />
        He keeps me guessin<br />
        (thoda sheesha lagta hai)<br />
        Spontaneous<br />
        (Heere moti jadte hain)<br />
        He's so persuasive<br />
        (thoda sona lagta hai)<br />
        And I'm his lady<br />
        [Verse 2: Truth Hurts]<br />
        Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin<br />
        I'm entertainin, my number one fan<br />
        My back is achin, from our love makin<br />
        Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin<br />
        My ups, my downs, my high and my lows<br />
        From head to toe, he makes me glow<br />
        He hits the spot, he makes me hot<br />
        I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        [Chorus: Truth Hurts, (Lata Mangeshkar)]<br />

        He's so contagious<br />
        (thoda sheesha lagta hai)<br />
        He turns my pages<br />

        He's got me anxious<br />
        (thoda sona lagta hai)<br />
        He's what I waited for<br />
        (Thoda resham lagta hai)<br />
        He keeps me guessin<br />
        (thoda sheesha lagta hai)<br />
        Spontaneous<br />

        He's so persuasive<br />
        (thoda sona lagta hai)<br />
        And I'm his lady<br />
        You OG'd and you OD: addicted<br />
